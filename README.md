A fully interactive, browser-based dashboard designed to guide developers through a high-intensity **6-month preparation plan** for top-tier tech companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.).

Unlike standard roadmaps, this tracker integrates **Software Engineering (Java/React)**, **DevOps (Docker/K8s)**, and **AI/ML Engineering** into a single cohesive schedule alongside daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **📅 24-Week Interactive Timeline:** A Gantt-style view to track your macro progress across 6 months.
* **⚔️ Daily Drills & Boss Battles:** Every day includes 5 "Drill" problems (Easy/Medium) and 1 "Boss Battle" (Hard/Company-Specific).
* **🧠 Full Stack Integration:** Weekly technical goals covering Spring Boot, React, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and AI Model Serving.
* **💾 Local Persistence:** Your progress (checkboxes) and notes are **saved automatically** to your browser's Local Storage. You won't lose data on refresh.
* **📝 Integrated Notes:** A dedicated text area for every week to jot down patterns, syntax, or resources.
* **🏷️ Company Tags:** Problems are tagged by company (e.g., Google, Meta, Amazon) to help you prioritize.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack Path

This roadmap runs 4 parallel tracks to build a "T-Shaped" Engineer profile:

| **Backend** | Java Core, Spring Boot, Microservices, System Design, SQL/NoSQL |
| **Frontend** | React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Performance Optimization |
| **DevOps** | Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EC2/S3/RDS), GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Terraform |
| **AI/ML** | Python, NumPy/Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Vector DBs, RAG, OpenAI API Integration |
